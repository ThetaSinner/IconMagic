The aim of the Icon\+Magic is to make it super simple to change file icons in Windows.

Features
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Able to perform a complete scan of the registry to find existing references to icons.
\item The user can easily change the icon a registry key is pointing to.
\item Keeps a complete history of every change you make. The history file can be used to
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Roll back a change.
\item Revert all changes to a file type.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Future ideas}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
