\subsection{Detailed Description}
Record changes to \textquotesingle{}Default\+Icon\textquotesingle{} keys in the registry using a custom file format. 

Designed to manage a custom file format for storing changes made by Icon\+Magic to the registry. Each file extension for which Icon\+Magic has made registry changes will be associated with a list of all the values which have been assigned to the \textquotesingle{}Default\+Icon\textquotesingle{} subkey for that extension. This means that (in the best case) the user can choose to roll back changes, or even revert to the system\textquotesingle{}s default icon.
