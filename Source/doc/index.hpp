# IconMagic

You can find this project on its GitHub [page](https://github.com/ThetaSinner/IconMagic)

### The plan ###
The aim of the IconMagic is to make it super simple to change file icons in Windows.

Features
- Able to perform a complete scan of the registry to find existing references to icons.
- The user can easily change the icon a registry key is pointing to.
- Keeps a complete history of every change you make. The history file can be used to
 + Roll back a change.
 + Revert all changes to a file type.

### Future ideas ###
- The user should be able to add a new new file type to the registry and set its icon.
